    <h3>How to create a report</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the menu, click Add Report. A map will load. The first time 
            it loads, you will need to allow the app to access your location.
            If you do not allow this, the map will be centred on the UK.</li>
        </li>

        <li>Find the location of the dropped kerb on the map. 
            You can zoom in, pan, and toggle between the map view and satellite view to help you locate the dropped kerb.
            Notice that in map-view you can see the outline of paths and roads.
        </li>
        
        <li>Click on the button in the top left of the map to activate report mode. 
            The button will turn orange and your cursor will turn into a + (crosshair), which means you can now click on the location of the dropped kerb on the map.</li>
        <li>Optional: Select the condition of the dropped kerb, where:
            <ul>
                <li>Green: The dropped kerb is usable and in good condition.</li>
                <li>Orange: The dropped kerb is usable but needs improvement.</li>
                <li>Red: The dropped kerb is dangerous not usable.</li>
                <li>Blue: There is no dropped kerb at this location but one is needed to provide access.</li>
            </ul>
        If you select either Orange or Red, please select at least one reason why.
        You many also leave a comment to further clarify your reason for selecting the condition.</li>
