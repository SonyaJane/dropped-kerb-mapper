## Testing User Stories

1. **Add a dropped kerb location**  
   As a Site User I want to add the location of a dropped kerb by clicking on a map so that I can contribute accurate data to the database.  

   **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - An interactive map is displayed on the submission page.  
   - Clicking on the map places a marker at the chosen point.  
   - The latitude and longitude of the marker are captured in the form.  

2. **Categorise the condition**  
   As a Site User I want to classify the dropped kerb using a traffic-light system so that others know its usability.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - The form shows a dropdown box with five options: None (default), Red, Orange, Green, or White.  
   - One option can be selected.  

3. **Provide reasons for the classification**  
   As a Site User I want to supply one or more contextual reasons for my condition choice so that I can explain my assessment.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - If the user selects Red or Orange, a dropdown list appears with relevant reasons or characteristics explaining the selected category.  
   - The user can select multiple reasons to provide context.

4. **Upload a photo**  
   As a Site User I want to optionally upload a photo of the dropped kerb so that others can visually verify its condition, and wheelers can judge for themselves if they can use it.
   **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - The form accepts image files (jpg, png, webp).  
   - Uploaded images are converted to WebP and compressed.  
   - Photo upload is optional but validated if provided. 

5. **Receive submission confirmation**  
   As a Site User I want to see a success message when my report is saved so that I know my contribution is recorded.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - On valid submission, an HTMX partial confirms success inline.  
   - The new marker appears on the map without a full page reload.  

6. **Register and log in**  
   As a Site User I can register an account and log in so that I can create, view, edit, and delete my own reports.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - Users sign up with email and password.  
   - Email confirmation link auto-confirms and logs the user in.  

7. **Edit a report**  
   As a Site User I want to edit my existing report so that I can correct mistakes or update information.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - The edit form is pre-populated with the original data.  
   - On valid update, a success message displays and redirects to detail view.  

8. **Delete a report**  
   As a Site User I want to delete my own report so that I can remove obsolete or erroneous entries.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - Only the owner or a superuser may delete.  
   - After deletion, the user is redirected to the reports list with a success message.  

9. **View a map of reports**  
   As a Site User I want to see all my reports plotted on an interactive map so that I can visualise their locations.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - Markers are colour-coded by condition.  
   - Clicking a marker shows a summary popup with thumbnail and condition.

10. **Contact support**  
    As a Site User I want to send feedback or questions via a contact form so that I can communicate with the site team.  
    **Acceptance Criteria**  
    - The contact page shows a form asking name, email, and message.  
    - On valid submission, emails are sent to the admin and a confirmation to the user.  
    - A success message displays on the contact page.  
  
11. **Filter and search reports (admin)**  
    As a Site Admin I want to filter and search all reports by date, user, location, or condition so that I can manage the data.  
    **Acceptance Criteria**  
    - The django admin interface provides sidebar filters for condition, reasons, user, and date.  
    - A search box allows keyword lookup in reasons and comments.  

12. **Proxy map tiles**  
    As a user the app should load consistent map tiles so that I see the same Ordnance Survey and Google Satellite imagery.  
    **Acceptance Criteria**  
    - OS raster tiles are served via the `/os_tiles/â€¦/` endpoint with caching headers.  
    - Google satellite tiles use a valid session token and return proper cache controls on 404.

## Code Validation

### HTML

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the project HTML code to ensure there were no syntax errors.
 
W3C Markup Validator found the following errors for the home page:

<img src="readme-files/html_validator_errors.png" alt="Home page validation errors image" style="width:600px;">

The errors were solved by removing the second use of the id 'not-logged-in',and adding the id="home-title-md" to the cover title.

<img src="readme-files/html_validator_errors_corrected.png" alt="Home page validation errors corrected" style="width:500px;">

W3C Markup Validator found the following errors in the add report (map) page:

**HTMX Attributes**

<img src="readme-files/htmx_error.png" alt="HTMX errors image" style="width:600px;">

These are not valid on the `<form>` element itself according to the HTML spec. 
The warning could be avoided by moving the hx-post, hx-target, and hx-swap 
attributes to the submit button inside the form, but we cannot as we use
Crispy to generate the form fields and button.

There were five other errors found in elements generated by Cripsy forms, such as the following:

<img src="readme-files/hidden_form_control_error.png" alt="Hidden form control errors image" style="width:700px;">

The label is rendered for a field that is within a hidden container, but this is 
expected here since the form is hidden by default for UX reasons, 
but becomes visible and accessible when the user clicks on the map to add a new report.

### CSS

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) service was used to validate the CSS code to ensure there were no syntax errors. 

One error was found.

<img src="readme-files/css_validator_error.png" alt="CSS validation image" style="width:700px;">

This was fixed by using the longhand properties for SVG masking.

### JavaScript

[JSHints JavaScript Code Quality Tool](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the JavaScript code. 

Missing colons were found and added.

### Python

Pylint was used continuously during the development process to check the Python code for programming errors.

[The Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was also used to validate the Python code 
for PEP8 requirements. The validation results are shown below. All errors were fixed.

Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools was used to confirm that the colours and fonts used 
in the website are easy to read and accessible. See reports in the table below:

</table>

Note that the low score for performance for the create report page is due to the 
map tiles loading and the map markers being created. Loading time was reduced by 
delaying the creation of the markers popups content until the marker is clicked
by the user. The acessibility score of 96 is due to the aria-labels added to the
markers by MapLibre GL JS. The SEO score of 91 is due to the links not being crawlable
but this is not an issue because this page is only visible to users who are
logged-in.
